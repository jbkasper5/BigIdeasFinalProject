## Overview  
    This project is meant to discover the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by using datasets taken from WPRDC (Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center). Specifically, our group chose to represent the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the one that Spider-Man would be able to operate in most effectively. In order for Spider-Man to operate effectively in any given neighborhood, there needs to be crime for him to stop (a crime metric), people for him to save (a population metric), and he has to be able to cover enough territory without becoming overwhelmed (a size metric). This project uses python and pandas to explore data pertaining to these three metrics, and attempts to rate the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh according to the needs and talents of Spider-Man.
